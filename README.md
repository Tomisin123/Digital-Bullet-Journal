## Overview

### Description
App implementation based on bulletjournal.com methodology that allows users to quickly log daily tasks and engage in reviews

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Productivity
- **Mobile:** The use of the mobile app reduces a lot of the implicit friction that comes with using a physical journal or laptop. Users are allowed to quickly make entries and changes on their phone.
- **Story:** Creates an environment where users can quickly and effectively organize their daily and longer term todos and goals
- **Market:** Anybody who would like to organize their productivity and have a simple way to plan out their days/months
- **Habit:** The daily use is implicit in the idea, possible app reminders if a user falls off
- **Scope:** Scope of the project intends to stay as narrow as possible in order to keep simplicity in app and not overwhelm users
